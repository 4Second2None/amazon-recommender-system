## An Optimized Recommender System from Integrating Multiple Algorithms
 
Team members : Sewon Min, Chaofan Han
 
### Project Abstract
This project aims to build an integrated recommender system with versatile features based on the Amazon reviews dataset. This project tries to solve problems confronting present recommender systems such as how to improve the degree of automation, how to make algorithms run faster and more robust with parallel computation.

### The main contents of this project are following:
- Implementation of various algorithms
- Different ways of ensemble learning of the algorithms
- Support of parallel tasks on distributed system, and performance/time comparison of each algorithm by the number of computation instances
- Implementation of demo program of the final recommender system

### Algorithms to be implemented:
- Content-based Recommender System
- Collaborative Filtering
- Weight Learning
- Latent Factor Model
- Bias Extension
- Ensemble Model 

### Datasets
- Amazon Review Data accessed from (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon-links.html)
- Number of reviews : 34,686,770
- Number of users : 6,643,669 (56,772 with more than 50 reviews)
- Number of products : 2,441,053

### Tools
- Python, Myria, AWS


### Progress

1. Download data
You need to have 'data' directory in your HOME.

```bash
chmod +x download.sh; ./download.sh 
```

This will takes several minutes.

2. Preprocess data (current step)
```bash
python -m prepro.main
```

You can read code from prepro/main.
'entry_list' is a list of each entry

3. Create DB

4. Implementation of Recommender System
